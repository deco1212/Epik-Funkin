please bro dont play these pieces of crap they are built into a fucking unstable engine bro

Info
All of those were built on the Modding + engine
Which was basically the easiest way to make mods back at the time
But the engine is ass and unstable and has an nightmare fueled input system
And i need to archive those completely so if some mf just edits them or deletes them heres a google drive link
(gonna put one later)
